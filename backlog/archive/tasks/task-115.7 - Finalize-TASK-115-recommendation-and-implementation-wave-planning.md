## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Consolidate spike results, module mapping, and pilot outcomes into a final recommendation package and define the next implementation wave as decision-complete subtasks.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Publish final recommendation with supporting evidence and explicit rejected alternatives.
- [ ] #2 Confirm parent and subtask sequencing/dependencies are up to date and reflect execution reality.
- [ ] #3 Document residual risks, open questions, and deferred items that require explicit future decisions.
- [ ] #4 Prepare next-wave implementation tasks with clear acceptance criteria and testing expectations.
