## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Improve perceived quality and usability of the task management UI by adding tasteful motion/transitions to key interactions and performing a general visual polish review.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Transitions are added for key UI state changes (including tab/view switches) without reducing readability or responsiveness.
- [ ] #2 Drag-and-drop interactions (including card movement and trash/archive affordances) provide clear motion/feedback during hover, drop, and completion states.
- [ ] #3 Motion behavior respects reduced-motion preferences where applicable.
- [ ] #4 A visual polish pass is completed for spacing, hierarchy, and consistency across affected views.
- [ ] #5 Automated tests are added or updated where practical to validate behavior, and existing relevant tests continue to pass.
