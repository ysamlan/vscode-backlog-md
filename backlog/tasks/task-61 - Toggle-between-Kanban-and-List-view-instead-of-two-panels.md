## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Currently the sidebar shows both Kanban Board and Task List as separate panels. Change this to a single panel with a toggle button to switch between Kanban and List views.

This would provide a cleaner UX with more vertical space for content.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Single sidebar panel for tasks
- [ ] #2 Toggle button to switch between Kanban and List views
- [ ] #3 View preference persists across sessions
- [ ] #4 Smooth transition between views
<!-- AC:END -->
