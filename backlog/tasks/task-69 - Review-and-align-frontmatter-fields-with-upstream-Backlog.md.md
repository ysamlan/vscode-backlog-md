## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Audit the MrLesk/Backlog.md source code to ensure this extension supports all available frontmatter fields and functionality. Compare our Task type, parser, and writer against the upstream definitions.

Key areas to review:
- Task frontmatter schema (all fields, types, optional/required)
- Config file options
- Sorting and ordering logic
- Any new fields or features we may be missing
