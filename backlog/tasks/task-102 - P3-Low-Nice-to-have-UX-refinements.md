## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Low-priority refinements identified in TASK-88 UX review. These are nice-to-have improvements for views that already work reasonably well.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 P3-1: Docs and Decisions views — no changes needed beyond tab bar fix (already done in P0-2)
- [x] #2 P3-2: Dashboard Total card completion percentage positioned below number instead of inline to avoid crowding at narrow widths
- [x] #3 P3-3: Task detail meta grid minmax reduced from 200px to 150px to maintain 2-column layout at 400px (styles.css:968)
- [x] #4 P3-4: Action buttons at bottom of task detail use sticky positioning so they're always accessible without scrolling
