## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add clear onboarding guidance in the init flow so users can install Backlog.md binary tools and configure the MCP server for their AI assistant/LLM by following the official upstream instructions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 When relevant in the init/onboarding experience, users are clearly directed to the official Backlog.md repository for installation and setup instructions.
- [ ] #2 Guidance explicitly covers both binary tool installation and MCP server setup context for AI assistants/LLMs.
- [ ] #3 The guidance uses stable repository/install links and copy that is easy to follow from within the extension UI.
- [ ] #4 If setup cannot be completed in-app, the user is still given an unambiguous next step to complete installation externally.
- [ ] #5 Any affected docs/UI text are updated and verified for consistency with current extension terminology.
